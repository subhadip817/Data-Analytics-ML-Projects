# Medical Treatment : Personalized Medicine - Redefining Cancer Treatment

## Description

  - A lot has been said during the past several years about how precision medicine and, more concretely, how genetic testing is going to disrupt the way diseases like cancer are treated.

  - But this is only partially happening due to the huge amount of manual work still required. Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers).

  - Currently this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.

## Problem Statement

  - We need to develop a Machine Learning algorithm that Predict the effect of Genetic Variants to enable Personalized Medicine.
